# ConvAutoencodersMNIST
The focus of this project is to build a convolutional neural network which uses autoencoders to encode and then reconstruct digit from the MNIST dataset. In particular, we are going to use PyTorch as a framework. It's suggested to who has already some experience of neural networks, but you can eventually find some theory and math in [this article](https://pgaleone.eu/neural-networks/2016/11/24/convolutional-autoencoders/) and in [this article](https://algorithmia.com/blog/convolutional-neural-nets-in-pytorch). The TSNE projection is inspired by code that can be found [here](https://github.com/despoisj/LatentSpaceVisualization). The data for the network are download trough the pytorch datasets. The file *net* contains the network while the file *train_and_vis* do all the training, testing and output studies. Keep in mind this is a **student-like** approach to autoencoders and should be taken accordingly. Feel free to give me feedbacks. A Jupyter notebook that you can find in the project folder explains more in detail the reasoning behind the code to help you approaching the project.
