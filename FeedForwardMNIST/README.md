# Feed-ForwardMNIST
Simple approach to the handwritten digit recognition trough neural network for beginners. This is meant to be a simple example of how we can tackle the MNIST dataset using pytorch. This is **not** meant to be some state-of-art implementation, but a possible help for students looking for easy implementations.
